# Face-Mask-Detection-Project
In this project I have used open cv library of python and CNN to train the model.
The original dataset is prepared by [Prajna Bhandary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prajna-bhandary-0b03a416a/) 
and available at [Github](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data)
